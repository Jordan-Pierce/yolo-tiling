This module can cut images and corresponding labels from YOLO dataset into tiles of specified size and create a
new dataset based on these tiles. It supports both object detection and instance segmentation. Credit for the original
repository goes to [slanj](https://github.com/slanj/yolo-tiling).


## Installation

To install the package, use pip:

```bash
pip install yolo-tiling
```

## Usage

```python
from yolo_tiler import YoloTiler, TileConfig

src = "path/to/dataset"  # Source YOLO dataset directory
dst = "path/to/tiled_dataset"  # Output directory for tiled dataset

config = TileConfig(
    # Size of each tile (width, height). Can be:
    # - Single integer for square tiles: slice_wh=640
    # - Tuple for rectangular tiles: slice_wh=(640, 480)
    slice_wh=(640, 480),

    # Overlap between adjacent tiles. Can be:
    # - Single float (0-1) for uniform overlap percentage: overlap_wh=0.1
    # - Tuple of floats for different overlap in each dimension: overlap_wh=(0.1, 0.1)
    # - Single integer for pixel overlap: overlap_wh=64
    # - Tuple of integers for different pixel overlaps: overlap_wh=(64, 48)
    overlap_wh=(0.1, 0.1),

    # Input image file extension to process
    input_ext=".png",

    # Output image file extension to save (default: same as input_ext)
    output_ext=None,

    # Type of YOLO annotations to process:
    # - "object_detection": Standard YOLO format (class, x, y, width, height)
    # - "instance_segmentation": YOLO segmentation format (class, x1, y1, x2, y2, ...)
    annotation_type="instance_segmentation",

    # For segmentation only: Controls point density along polygon edges
    # Lower values = more points, higher quality but larger files
    densify_factor=0.01,

    # For segmentation only: Controls polygon smoothing
    # Lower values = more details preserved, higher values = smoother shapes
    smoothing_tolerance=0.99,

    # Dataset split ratios (must sum to 1.0)
    train_ratio=0.7,  # Proportion of data for training
    valid_ratio=0.2,  # Proportion of data for validation
    test_ratio=0.1,   # Proportion of data for testing

    # Optional margins to exclude from input images. Can be:
    # - Single float (0-1) for uniform margin percentage: margins=0.1
    # - Tuple of floats for different margins: margins=(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
    # - Single integer for pixel margins: margins=64
    # - Tuple of integers for different pixel margins: margins=(64, 64, 64, 64)
    margins=0.0,

    # Include negative samples (tiles without any instances)
    include_negative_samples=True
)

tiler = YoloTiler(
    source=src,
    target=dst,
    config=config,
    num_viz_samples=15,  # Number of samples to visualize
    callback=progress_callback  # Optional callback function to report progress
)

tiler.run()
```

The tiler requires a YOLO dataset structure in both source and target directories. If only a `train` folder exists, the train / valid / test ratios will be used to split the tiled `train` folder; else, the ratios are ignored.

```bash
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
├── valid/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
├── test/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
└── data.yaml  # Optional
```

## Command Line Usage

You can also use the command line interface to run the tiling process. Here are the instructions:

```bash
yolo-tiling --source --target [--slice_wh SLICE_WH SLICE_WH] [--overlap_wh OVERLAP_WH OVERLAP_WH] [--input_ext INPUT_EXT] [--output_ext OUTPUT_EXT] [--annotation_type ANNOTATION_TYPE] [--densify_factor DENSIFY_FACTOR] [--smoothing_tolerance SMOOTHING_TOLERANCE] [--train_ratio TRAIN_RATIO] [--valid_ratio VALID_RATIO] [--test_ratio TEST_RATIO] [--margins MARGINS] [--include_negative_samples INCLUDE_NEGATIVE_SAMPLES]
```

### Test Data
```bash
python tests/test_yolo_tiler.py
```

### Example Commands

1. Basic usage with default parameters:
```bash
yolo-tiling --source tests/detection --target tests/detection_tiled
```

2. Custom slice size and overlap:
```bash
yolo-tiling --source tests/detection --target tests/detection_tiled --slice_wh 640 480 --overlap_wh 0.1 0.1
```

3. Custom annotation type and image extension:
```bash
yolo-tiling --source tests/segmentation --target tests/segmentation_tiled --annotation_type instance_segmentation --input_ext .jpg --output_ext .png
```

### Memory Efficiency

The `tile_image` method now uses rasterio's Window to read and process image tiles directly from the disk, instead of loading the entire image into memory. This makes the tiling process more memory efficient, especially for large images.
